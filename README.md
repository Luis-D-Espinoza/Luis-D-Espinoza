**`Perpetual Learner (Tech/History/Games)`**

I'm a former historian with an itch to create beyond in black and white. As a self-taught frontend developer I cherish every project made from scratch that allows to me grow thorugh creative solutions like civilizations before.  Through my published writings in [history]() and [tech]() you can find more insight on my past and running endeavor.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on frontend for a history sharing website for students, teachers, and enthusiasts
- ðŸŒ± I continue to improve on my javascript fundamentals
